                        <p>
                            My first week at Mctaba Labs was a whirlwind of tags and attributes. 
                            I started out not knowing the difference between a div and a section, 
                            but now I understand how to structure a full webpage!

                    <h4 style=" font-size: 25px">Why Semantic HTML Matters</h4>
                    <p>
                        I learned that Semantic HTML is about giving meaning to code. 
                        Using tags like article, nav, and footer
                        helps screen readers and search engines understand what my content 
                        actually is, making the web better for everyone.

                    <p>
                        The project that I'm proud for is The Empowerher academic Portal. his project is more than just a website, it is a digital gateway designed to bridge the gap between potential and opportunity for the girl child.
                        My goal was to create a central hub for a premier educational institution that focuses on building 'Girls of Substance. To achieve this, I focused on a rigorous academic foundation not just in the curriculum, but in my code.</p>
